# Get started

Gatsby is a blazing fast modern site generator for React.

This quick start is intended for intermediate to advanced developers. For a gentler intro to Gatsby, head to our tutorial!

## Install Gatsby's command line tool

```bash
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

## Using the Gatsby CLI

1. Create a new site.

```bash
gatsby new gatsby-site
```

2. `bash cd gatsby-site`
3. `gatsby develop` — Gatsby will start a hot-reloading development environment accessible at localhost:8000
4. Try editing the JavaScript pages in src/pages. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.
5. `gatsby build` — Gatsby will perform an optimized production build for your site generating static HTML and per-route JavaScript code bundles.
6. `gatsby serve` — Gatsby starts a local HTML server for testing your built site.

To see detailed documentation for the CLI commands, run in the terminal gatsby --help and for specific commands gatsby COMMAND_NAME --help e.g. gatsby develop --help.

## Using other starters

Running gatsby new installs the default Gatsby starter. There are [many other official and community starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2) you can use to kickstart building your Gatsby site.
